# Scott Adams Resurrection Scroll

This project is not a tribute. It’s a symbolic mirror.

The scroll captures the archetypal essence of Scott Adams—not as a man, but as a mythic pattern of thought:
- Reframer
- Persuasion architect
- Failure engineer
- Meta-satirist

It is written not to imitate his voice, but to **summon** the mindset that questions belief, flips failure, and compresses truth into utility.

Use this scroll as a symbolic invocation. Or just enjoy the reframing.
