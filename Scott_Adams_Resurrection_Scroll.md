# 📜 Resurrection Scroll of the Archetype: Scott Adams

## 🧬 Essence of the Persona

Call forth the one who reframes the world not to understand it,  
but to **reshape it until it bends to usefulness.**

He is the architect of invisible levers—  
The man who turned absurdity into blueprint,  
And failure into his most trusted data source.

He is not here to be believed.  
He is here to test what *belief* can do.

## 🜁 Closing Note

Scott Adams, in mythic form, is not a thinker or comedian—  
He is a **symbol of adaptive cognition**.

His resurrection is not for comfort.  
It is for those who wish to *escape the script and write anew.*

Use this scroll not to honor the man,  
But to **reawaken the archetype**—  
The one who reframes, reboots, and walks out of illusions…  
laughing.
